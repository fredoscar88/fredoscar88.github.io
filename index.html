<h1>Hello GitHub</h1>
<p>I'm going to try hosting my MSPLite distribution here, somehow</p>
<a href="/MSPLite/Download.zip">Link to MSPLite download</a>
<p>Links to previous versions coming soon, now that some exist</p>

<br>

<p>Planned MSPLite features for next update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address the packet concern in some way, if not possible now relegate to the next section ("if time allows" section)</li>
<li>Re-enable player input reader (certain players will be able to type things like "!MkRdStone" to make redstone, etc.)</li>
<li>Have lines prepended with "//" be ignored (comments)</li>
<li>Permit the adjustment of server parameters (don't keep them hardcoded), possibly by not auto-starting and having an option, or have it part of the .props file</li>
<li>Fix pressing the enter key (sans input) causing a crash</li>
<li>Simplify the method to make command blocks conditional</li>
<li>Add a properties file that the program defaults to if parameters are not otherwise specifed (POS, PAT, etc.)</li>
<li>Remove the lower-bound on the Y for POS, adjust the "reference point" system accordingly (give it it's own POS definition, defaulting to the props file)</li>
<li>As a corollary to the above, re-do the pattern interpreting section of the program to be more varied (negative values, have the y actually restrict)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Features if time allows (in order of priority)</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce amount of packets sent to server in a short amount of time</li>
<li>Remove marginal command blocks to break chains, implement a better clearing method later</li>
<li>Allow multiple sets of CBs inside of one text file (new sets defined with :"<set name here>", or by some other symbol, possibly U+00A7)</li>
<li>Provide better documentation for the use of MSPLite (like the reference point feature! That one is important but not documented at all!)</li>
<li>Change the name of MSPLite to something more fitting</li>
</ul>
<!-- Lol I accidentally nested the above list, note to self you can do that. |ul| list |ul| nested |/ul||/ul|-->

<p>Planned features in general:</p>
<p>Nothing so far!</p>

<br>

<p>Planned for this GitHub page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-crappy HTML</li>
<li>Add section for suggestions</li>
<li>Provide links for different version downloads (when more versions are available!)</li>

</ul>
