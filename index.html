<!-- Heyyyy comment -->
<h1>Hello GitHub</h1>
<p>Latest MSP Version: Alpha 1.0.2</p>
<a href="/MSPLite/Download.zip">Link to MSPLite download</a>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<p>Hoo boy, is this one helluvan update</p>
<ul>
<li>-Changed syntax handling</li>
<li>-Adding ":NEW SET" to a file now starts a new chain of command blocks</li>
<li>-"POS" and "PAT" when defined after ":NEW SET" define the position (of the first block) and pattern of that set</li>
<li>-If "POS/PAT" aren't specified after ":NEW SET", the "POS/PAT" default to what's in MSP.properties</li>
<li>-Due to the logic of the other above features it is now possible to overwrite previous command block lines</li>
<li>-Updated line interpreting, fixed a bug regarding the first "block line" of a file</li>
<li>-Added ability to change the redstone directory (now you can switch between projects more easily)</li>
<li>-Added ability to turn on and off players' ability to run commands, like "!OpMe". This is the OIT setting and defaults to false.</li>
<li>-Added ability to add your own MSP enabled commands, inside "cc.txt" in the MSPPlayers directory</li>
<li>-Added advanced readme file, including a syntax guide and info on MSP.properties. See this for help withthe above 2 features.</li>
<li>-Added "scripting", you can write a list of commands to be executed at once in the Scripts directory</li>
<li>-Lines beginning with "//" are now treated as comments</li>
<li>-Added better support for identifying players on teams (when they run commands)</li>
<li>-Re-wrote, re-worked a lot of legacy code. Currently this is still sitting in the source, but is unused.</li>
<li>And probably some other minor details that I've neglected to mention</li>
<li>Need to create a comprehensive list of bugs at some point, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Planned MSPLite features for next update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address the packet concern in some way, if not possible now relegate to the next section ("if time allows" section)</li>
<li>Re-enable player input reader (certain players will be able to type things like "!MkRdStone" to make redstone, etc.)</li>
<li>Have lines prepended with "//" be ignored (comments)</li>
<li>Permit the adjustment of server parameters (don't keep them hardcoded), possibly by not auto-starting and having an option, or have it part of the .props file</li>
<li>Fix pressing the enter key (sans input) causing a crash</li>
<li>Simplify the method to make command blocks conditional</li>
<li>Add a properties file that the program defaults to if parameters are not otherwise specifed (POS, PAT, etc.)</li>
<li>Remove the lower-bound on the Y for POS, adjust the "reference point" system accordingly (give it it's own POS definition, defaulting to the props file)</li>
<li>As a corollary to the above, re-do the pattern interpreting section of the program to be more varied (negative values, have the y actually restrict)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Features if time allows (in order of priority)</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce amount of packets sent to server in a short amount of time</li>
<li>Remove marginal command blocks to break chains, implement a better clearing method later</li>
<li>Allow multiple sets of CBs inside of one text file (new sets defined with :"<set name here>", or by some other symbol, possibly U+00A7)</li>
<li>Provide better documentation for the use of MSPLite (like the reference point feature! That one is important but not documented at all!)</li>
<li>Change the name of MSPLite to something more fitting</li>
</ul>
<!-- Lol I accidentally nested the above list, note to self you can do that. |ul| list |ul| nested |/ul||/ul|-->

<p>Planned features in general:</p>
<p>Nothing so far!</p>

<br>

<p>Planned for this GitHub page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-crappy HTML</li>
<li>Add section for suggestions</li>
<li>Provide links for different version downloads (when more versions are available!)</li>

</ul>
